   <p><h2>What you need:</h2>
      <div class="left">
      <ul>
         <li>Two sheets of letter paper, or preferably thin card</li>
         <li>Scissors</li>
         <li>A split-pin fastener</li>
         <li>Optional: one sheet of transparent plastic, e.g. acetate designed for use with overhead projectors</li>
         <li>Optional: A little glue</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
   </p>
   <p><h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <div class="left">
      <ol>
         <li>Download a planisphere kit from above.</li>
         <li> Print the star wheel and the body of the planisphere onto two separate sheets of paper, or more preferably onto thin card. If you have any transparent plastic to hand, e.g. acetate sheets for use on overhead projectors, you should print the altitude/azimuth grid onto a sheet of plastic. If you do not have any acetate to hand, don't worry â€“ your planisphere will work fine without it!</li>
         <li>Carefully cut out the star wheel and the body of the planisphere. Also cut out the shaded grey area of the planisphere's body, and if you have it, the grid of lines which you have printed onto transparent plastic. If you are using cardboard, you may wish to carefully score the body of the planisphere along the dotted line to make it easier to fold it along this line later.</li>
         <li>The star wheel has a small circle at its center, and the planisphere's body has a matching small circle at the bottom. Make a small hole (about 2mm across) in each. If you have a paper drill to hand, these are ideal, but otherwise you can use a compass point and enlarge the hole until it is around 2mm across by turning the point in a circular motion.</li>
         <li>Slot a split-pin fastener through the middle of the star wheel, with the head of the fastener against the printed side of the star wheel. Then slot the body of the planisphere onto the same fastener, with the printed side facing the back of the fastener. Fold the fastener down to secure the two sheets of cardboard together.</li>
         <li>(optional) If you printed the altitude/azimuth grid onto a sheet of plastic, you should now stick this grid of lines over the viewing window which you cut out from the body of the planisphere.</li>
         <li>Fold the body of the planisphere along the dotted line, so that the front of the star wheel shows through the window which you cut in the body.</li>
